# Rover (Personal Project)

## Overview
Personal rover project developed to practice and demonstrate embedded engineering skills:
firmware structure, peripherals control, and hardware validation on real boards.

## Goals
- Modular and testable firmware architecture
- Clear separation: BSP / Drivers / App
- Reproducible builds and documented wiring
- Incremental validation (one peripheral at a time)

## Current status
- [ ] Define hardware platform (MCU/board, motor driver, sensors)
- [ ] Bring-up: GPIO + PWM + serial logging
- [ ] Motor control baseline (PWM + direction)
- [ ] Sensors integration
- [ ] Power and safety checks
- [ ] Field testing and iteration

## Repo structure (planned)
